Numbers & variables

with or without decimals, exponentiation, one type

64-bit floating point, double precision floating point numbers,
IEEE 754 standard...
0-51(value/fraction/mantissa)	52-62(exponent)		63(sign)

precision
up to 15 digits without a period or ...
17 decimals and low accuracy
always ensure about the precision you want to use to avoid sides effects
0.1 + 0.2 != 0.3
0.1 * 10 + 0.2 * 10 == 0.3

adding numbers and strings
+ both adds and concat
number + number, s + s, n + s, s + n
interpreter works from left to right
s + n + n != s + (n + n)
n + n + s != n + n + s
numeric strings, js can deal with numbers in "" when operators are different
from '+'
NaN(Not a legal number) computation with non-numeric operands
x = n / s => NaN
isNaN();
NaN type = number
Infinity type = number
Hexadecimal var x = 0xFF
07 type is octal avoid 0 in front
toString(); change base
numbers as object using new Number();
